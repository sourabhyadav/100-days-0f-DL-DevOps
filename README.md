# 100-days-0f-DL-DevOps
Summary of my learning in 100 days of DL and DevOps related stuff. 

### Day 1: Numpy Revision 1  
* Revised few concepts of ndarray and methods related to init and built-in functions
* Started with concepts required in deep learning wrt to numpy  

### Day 2: Numpy Revision 2  
* Revised the concept of indexing and slicing (:) and elipcies (...) in numpy
* Slicing works on each dimesion of the given array. 
* Basic syntax of slicing for each dimesion is start:stop:step

### Day 3: Array Broadcasting and Iteration  
* Broadcasting has some rules which performs broadcasting for addition and multiplication differently  
* We can also use broadcasting based on boolean condtion inside the array   
* For iteration we can use nditer function and can also define the C-style(row-wise) and F-style(col-wise)   

### Day 4: Array manipulation using built-in functions 1  
* Method for chaning shape like reshape, flaten 
* Method for transpose like tranpose(), a.T, swapazes etc.   
* Methods for changing dimension and broadcasting like broadcast, broadcast_to etc.
